# Who am I

* I am from Paris, France.
* I am learning Data Analytics @IronHack Paris.
* I don't have much experience with technology/data, but I am curious!

# Why am I here

* I enrolled @IronHack to be better and faster at manipulating large amount of data.
* I expect to be knowledgeable about Python and display data in a beautiful way.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* I will seek employment in small-scale but growing companies.
* Depending on the size of the company, I intend to be CFO or Head of FP&A.
* My career goal is to be able to retire :)
